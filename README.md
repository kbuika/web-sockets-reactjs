## Web Sockets (Socket.io)

“WebSockets” is an advanced technology that allows real-time interactive communication between the client browser and a server. It uses a completely different protocol that allows bidirectional data flow, making it unique against HTTP.

### HTTP Vs WebSockets
HTTP typically sends requests and waits for a response, WebSockets on the other hand allow for bidirectional flow of data so you just have to listen for data, you do not have to send a request.

You can just listen to the server and it will send you a message when it’s available.
